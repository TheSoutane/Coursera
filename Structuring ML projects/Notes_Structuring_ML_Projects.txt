Week 1 Course
	Orthogonalisation
		Separates parameters and makes them orthogonal by working iteratively on the follwing steps
			Fit train test
			Fit on dev set
			Fit on test set
			Fit in real world
		Idea is to divide and conquer
	Single number evaluation metric
		simplifies decision making
		If using multiple metrics (ex recall & precision), differenciating might become complicated
	Satisficing and Optimizing metric
		Not always possible to combine all the interresting var into one
			ex: precision and run time
		Optimizing -> Wath you want to improve
		Satisficing -> Condition on algorithm (ex runtime below k msec)
	Train/dev/test distribution
		Must be from the same distribution
		Check for class balance in the train/test set
	Train/dev/test size 
		Traditionally: 70% train and 30% test
		Nowadays, much more data -> Nedd enought to test with statistical certainty
	Human level performance
		Can be used as approximation of Bayes error
