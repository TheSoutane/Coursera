Explanation using mathematical definition
 why the segment [-1, 1] represents a one-dimensional sphere
[-1, 1] is the ensemble of points with a distance lower than one to the origin. It is equivalent to the 1d sphere

 why  the square from -1 to 1 in x and from -1 to 1 in y is a unit cylinder in  two dimensions
Definition of a unit cylinder in dim d: sphere in dim d-1 and all points within [-1, 1]  in the last dimension. Here the points on the x axis in [-1, 1] are part of a sphere (cf previous point) and y is withing [-1, 1], matching the unit cylinder definition
Remark: x and y are interchangeable in the demo



 Confirm and explain that the unit cylinder in two dimensions has twice the volume of the unit sphere in one dimension
Definition of volume (specific to convex shapes): Span across the different dimensions. Let's assume that the unit sphere in 1d has a volume V, the final volume will be V_final = V * Span([-1, 1]) = 2*V. (Span([-1, 1]) = 2 as defined in the doc table)

Explain (prove) why the above relations
V_cyl(2) = 2 V_sph(1): Please refer to the previous bullet point
V_cyl(3) = 2 V_sph(2): Applying the same reasoning as before, replace V with V_sph(2) and we get this result
 V_cyl(d + 1) = 2 V_sh(d) : Applying the same reasoning as before, replace V with V_sph(d) and we get this result

Prove that Q(d) equals the ratio of the sphere volume in dimension (d) and the sphere volume in dimension (d-1), that is, prove that Q(d) = V_sph(d) / V_sph(d-1)
 V_cyl(d + 1) = 2 V_sh(d) is equivalent to  V_cyl(d) = 2 V_sh(d-1). If we replace V_cyl(d) with 2 V_sh(d-1) in the equation, we get to the result
