## Notes of the pluralsight WAS cloud practitionner course - Fundamental cloud concepts ##

Structure
Cloud - Introduction to cloud computing: SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS.
Services - This includes the following services:
	Computing and data processing (EC2, Lambda) to manage virtual machines and event-driven computation
	File Storage (S3) to store and access objects efficiently
	Networking (VPC, Route 53) to configure networks and routing
	Database to store SQL (RDS) and NoSQL (DynamoDB, SimpleDB) data
	Notification (SNS) services for portable devices like cell phones
	Message (SQS) storage and transfer service for communication and process management
	Others: Time Sync for accurate current time and CloudFormation to automate work, etc.
Security - Shared Security Model, Compliance and Artifact, Web Application Firewall(WAF), Inspector, Trust Advisor, CloudTrail, Cloud Watch, Identity and Access Management (IAM) services
Billing - The pricing and billing structure of different services as per usage, quota, and plans

Fundamental cloud concepts
	CC concepts
		Data enters
			Traditional data centers
				Built on premises
				Long building time
				Lack of flexibility in terms of location
				High CAPEX
				Limited scalability
				High capabilities required
			Cloud computing
				economies of scale
				No CAPEX
				Scalability
					no need to guess capacity required
				More agile to switch machines
				No maintenance needed
				Easy geographical deployment
			key concepts
				elasticity
					Ability to change loads managed by infrastructure
				reliability
					Continuity of service
				Agility
					Cost of change, trying smtg new
		Types of CC	models
			in order of control:
				IaaS ( infrastructure as a service)
					Responsible of all except maintennace of chips
				PaaS (Platform as a service)
				SaaS (Software as a service)
			deployment models
				Public cloud	
					All on provider's infrastructure
				On Premise
					in the name :)
				Hybrid
					mix of Public and on premises		
	AWS globally
		Regions
			Specific geographic location
			W cluster of data centers
			
		Availability zone
			One or more data enters
			Multiple per region
			In the geographic area of the region
			Redundant 
				power, network and connectivity
			Naming:
				area-sub_area -> Regions
				number -> availability zone
				ex: us-east-2a	
		Local Zone
			forefronts of the AWS centers
			High capacity connectin
			Goal is to emit/collect data in an optimum way
		wavelenght zones
			Same for wireless
		edge location 
			Nodes of the content delivery network 
	Economics 
		Costs structure
			CapEx VS Opex
		Tools for cost organisation
			Aws cost explorer
				Breaks down by service/ cost tag
				Provides predictions for the next 3 monts
				Provides optimization reco
				available via API
			AWS budget
				Track costs per entity using cost explorer data
			Cost planning tools
				Pricing calculator
					estimates the costs of a defined infrastructure
				Migration hub
					Same for workload transition
			Ressources tags
				Metadata of a specific ressource
					Name and optional value
					Use case/dept or project
				reports
					costs grouped per active tage
			AWS Organisation
				manage multiple accounts under one master accounts
				Consolidated billing per accounts	easier mgmt
		moving to the cloud
			Pre-define
				Current workloads
				Forecasted infrastructure needs
				Cost analysis of both options
			AWS Migration hub	
				Sort of doc providing the possible tools
			Migration evaluator
				Calculate needs and help building business case
			Pricing calculator
				Quick or advanced estimates (diff levels of details)
		Cost exploration
			AWS cost explorer
				breakdown of costs per service/type			 
	Support tools and services
		Basic Support tools	
			AWS support
				Tiers differences
					Communication method
					response time
					Cost
					Offered guidance
				Different tiers
					Basic support	
						Trusted advisor
					Developer support
						Business hour mails
						1 primary contact
						29/month
					Business support	
						Full set of trusted advisor checks
						Direct call possible 24/7
						24/7 mail and chat access
						Unlimited contacts
						access to 3rd party software
						from 100/month
					Enterprise support	
						Designated technical account manager
						Concierge support team
						from 15 000 per month
			AWS personnal health
				Dashboards w alerts
			AWS Trusted advisor
				Compare your usage against best practices
				Accessible from AWS console
				7 free core checks per customer
					Cost, performance, Security, Fault tolerance, service limits
		Further ressources
			AWS Quickstart
				cloud workloads
			AWS partner metw consulting partnera
			AWS prof services
